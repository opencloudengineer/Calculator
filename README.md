# Calculator

## Little bit more than a simple Calculator built using HTML, CSS & Javascript


Just open index.html in any browser and it will open the calculator app in your browser window.

Also I have included the package.json and bootstrap.js files, so this app can be built and run using electron.

Just check the dependencies in package.json before building and running with electron.

### Do 'npm install' to install dependencies


Works succesfully in Mozilla Firefox v61.0 and also with electron too (Just do 'npm start').


##### Also included nthRoot function which can be use to used to calculate nth root of any number m by calling as nthRoot(m,n).

##### Brackets also added to enable BODMAS/PEMDAS.


Since I am using eval to calculate whats on screen, so

why don't you try calculating like - '2**4'
