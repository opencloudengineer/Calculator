# Calculator
Calculator built using HTML, CSS, Javascript


Just open index.html in any browser and it will open the calculator app in your browser window.
Also I have included the package.json and bootstrap.js files, so this app can be built and run using electron.
Just check the dependencies in package.json before building and running with electron.
